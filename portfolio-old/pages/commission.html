              <h2>Codec Recordings</h2>
              <p>Codec Recordings is a record label based in Dallas Texas run by Techno producer Decoder. In 2020, when the label was just getting started, I was contacted to make artwork for a compilation album. These prints were provided for their first compilation album which helped them gather recognition and become the label they are today. Please click on the image to view their soundcloud page and listen to their work.</p>

            <h2>Methuselah Records</h2>
            <p>Methuselah Records was a short endeavor from an anonymous producer based in San Fransisco. Releasing tracks under multiple alias', this artist founded the label to throw out tracks that didn't make the cut. He designed this label to not only post his own tracks, but also for a place his friends. Multiple releases are all from people in his close personal circle. I designed all the artwork for this label. </p>

          <h2>Servos</h2>
          <p>A Rhythmic Techno producer from Kyiv Ukraine. Not much is known about this artist. They created an EP and then went off the grids for about 2 years now. I liked designing their artwork because the music set the tone. Definetaly check out servos if you want to hear some unique techno.</p>
