            <h2>Mixes</h2>
          </a>
            <p>I remember road trips with family. Hypnotic dance music would always be playing. I guess that's the usual when your father is a dj. It sounded like the same song playing over and over. Honestly, it annoyed me. I didn't realize until much later, but those hypnotic beats would always be there playing. It aged on me like wine. I began to hear the subtle changes in the tracks. Learning to hear these changes helped develope my mixing abilities. Without the planting and nurturing of this ability, it would never have grew.  </p>

          <h2>Compositions</h2>
        </a>
          <p>Looking back, I realize that I only had an interest in creating music out of jealousy. When I was a teenager I had a friend who used to make music. I would go to his house and he'd be practicing piano, playing guitar, learning, and growing. One day he was making music on his computer. I fell in love. The freedom, the mountain, it would take time, but I had to get better than him. This is what inspired me to produce my own music. </p>

          <h2>Likes</h2>
        </a>
          <p>I would like to say that I'm one of those people that says "I like all types of music", but by even thinking about that statement I begin to cringe. There is no way statement or word that describes someones taste in music. Music can match a period of time or it can contradict. You could love a song one day and hate it the next. Music can be a description of your life or just a fantasy. The best way to describe music is by listening. </p>
